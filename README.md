# Mastermind Game

This is a code-breaking game where the user players a fictitious opponent.

## Getting Started

To run the game, you should have the latest version of Python installed, including pip.

1. Clone the Mastermind codebase from this repo.
2. (Recommended) Within the cloned folder, create a virtual environment using `venv`. From the command line, navigate to your desired location and run: `python -m venv venv`. Activate this environment by running: `source venv/bin/activate`. Ensure your virtual environment is active before proceeding.
3. Install the dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Tests can be run from the command line via `python -m unittest`.
5. Start the game via `flask run`. (If you wish to use an alternate port, run `flask run -p desired_port`).
6. In your browser, copy/paste the following link: `localhost:5002` (where _5002_ is the port specified after initiating `flask run`).
